LibreLab
=========

LibreLab is a free/open source software for laboratory data acquisition and analysis written in Python. 

It aims to be a free and open source alternative to proprietary black-box solutions such as Pasco's DataStudio/Capstone and Vernier Logger Pro for teaching experimental science and engineering in high schools and universities.

Currently, it can communicate with an open-hardware board based on the Atmel ATmega1284P microcontroller, whose schematics, PCB and firmware is available in this repository. However, there are plans for supporting other data acquisition devices in the future (for example, based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture).

Feel free to join the project.
